                with personalized membership services. VACASTAY uses personal information in several ways,
                including:</p>

            <ul className="unordered-lists">
                <li className="list">
                    Facilitating bookings that you have requested.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="normal-description-text">VACASTAY does not routinely disclose personal information except

                help maximize the quality and efficiency of our services and business operations. This means that
                individuals and organizations outside of VACASTAY, such as mail houses, will sometimes have access
                to personal information held by VACASTAY and may use it on behalf of VACASTAY. We require our
                service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it
                for any unauthorized purposes.</p>
